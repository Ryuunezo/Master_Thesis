# Mastery Thesis 

  The aim of the master's thesis was to develop a concept and to create GOTO system 
which use Raspberry Pi as the universal driver that can be easily modified by users 
(the user can modify the software by adding new code / class to the program or adds additional hardware (camera etc.)).
GOTO system is computerized mount for telescope which has electric motors that are used to control its position 
and driver which change digital signal from controller to electrical, which then is send to motors to adjast their position.
In addition to the main program in the project contains three classes which supports dc motor, encoder and PS3 controller.
